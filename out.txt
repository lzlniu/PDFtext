This first comprehensive analysis of the global biogeography of marine protistan
plankton with acquired phototrophy shows these mixotrophic organisms
to be ubiquitous and abundant; however, their biogeography differs markedly
between different functional groups. These mixotrophs, lacking a constitutive
capacity for photosynthesis (i.e. non-constitutive mixotrophs, NCMs), acquire
their phototrophic potential through either integration of prey-plastids or
through endosymbiotic associations with photosynthetic microbes. Analysis
of field data reveals that 40\U201360% of plankton traditionally labelled as (nonphototrophic)
microzooplankton are actually NCMs, employing acquired
phototrophy in addition to phagotrophy. Specialist NCMs acquire chloroplasts
or endosymbionts from specific prey, while generalist NCMs obtain
chloroplasts from a variety of prey. These contrasting functional types of
NCMs exhibit distinct seasonal and spatial global distribution patterns.
Mixotrophs reliant on \U2018stolen\U2019 chloroplasts, controlled by prey diversity and
abundance, dominate in high-biomass areas. Mixotrophs harbouring intact
symbionts are present in all waters and dominate particularly in oligotrophic
open ocean systems. The contrasting temporal and spatial patterns of distribution
of different mixotroph functional types across the oceanic provinces,
as revealed in this study, challenges traditional interpretations of marine
food web structures. Mixotrophs with acquired phototrophy (NCMs) warrant
greater recognition in marine research.

from a variety of prey (generalist NCMs, GNCMs; blue (a)), from specific prey ( plastidic specialist NCMs, pSNCMs; red (b)), or enslave entire specific autotrophic prey
as symbionts (endosymbiotic SNCMs, eSNCMs; green (c)). Images next to each map provide protist genus examples within each functional group. From left to right

grazed by \U2018animal-like\U2019 zooplankton. However, it is now recognized
that a large proportion of marine plankton do not follow
this traditional \U2018plant\U2013animal\U2019 dichotomy but are actually
mixotrophic protists\U2014single-celled organisms that can perform
both photosynthesis and phagocytosis simultaneously [2\U20135].
In reflection of this shift in our understanding of the marine
trophic paradigm, a new functional group classification of
marine planktonic protists has been proposed [6] in which
mixotrophic protists are broadly divided into constitutive
mixotrophs (i.e. those that have a constitutive ability to photosynthesize;
CMs), and non-constitutive mixotrophs (i.e. those
that donot possess an innate ability tophotosynthesize;NCMs).
The CM group conforms to the popular perception of a
planktonic mixotroph as a \U2018plant that eats\U2019 [7\U20139]. This group
includes many harmful algal bloom (HAB) species, which
have traditionally been considered strictly phototrophic [9].
NCMs, on the other hand, acquire the ability to photosynthesize
either by \U2018stealing\U2019 and using plastids from a variety of prey
(generalists; GNCMs) or acquiring plastids from specific prey
(plastidic specialists; pSNCMs); in some instances, they harbour
intact photosynthetic prey as symbionts (endosymbiotic
specialists; eSNCMs) [10\U201312]. However, the presence and
importance of NCMs is often overlooked, except for some
notable cases such as the ciliate Mesodinium rubrum and the
HAB dinoflagellates \U2018green Noctiluca\U2019and Dinophysis [13\U201316].
Here, we report the first analysis of the global biogeography
of non-constitutive mixotrophs\U2014marine predatory
plankton that exploit/use/recycle the photosynthetic machinery
of their prey. Our analysis shows that these organisms are
not only ubiquitous and abundant, but their biogeography
differs markedly between the different groups. Our study
establishes NCMs as important members of marine planktonic
food webs across different biogeographic provinces at large
spatial and temporal scales.
2. Methods
We conducted a global analysis of field data for the different
groups of non-constitutive mixotrophs (NCMs); see the electronic
supplementary material for detailed methods. Species were classified
a priori to the GNCM, pSNCM and eSNCM groups according
to their physiology. We adapted the Longhurst biogeographic
classification system for oceanic provinces (electronic supplementary
material, figure S1 and table S1) [17]; these provinces were
grouped into seven principal biomes according to primary production
and physical forcing. Coordinates corresponding to the
locations where mixotrophic species had been recorded were
aligned with these biogeographic provinces.
Qualitative data were obtained mainly from the Ocean
Biogeographic Information System (OBIS) database; over 110 000
distribution records of greater than 60 species were obtained

(electronic supplementary material, table S2). Quantitative data
were obtained through a bibliographic survey of the published
literature (1970 to present) using the ISI Web of Science database
on 13 March 2017. We targeted works from which the quantitative
contribution of mixotrophs to the microzooplankton assemblage
could be estimated. Over 180 articles were examined (electronic
supplementary material, table S3), of which approximately 45
articles provided quantitative data for mixotrophic oligotrich ciliates
(GNCMs) and the mixotrophic Mesodinium spp. (pSNCM),
hereafter referred to as Mesodinium (electronic supplementary
material, table S4). The relative contribution of mixotrophic
Rhizaria (eSNCMs) to the planktonic assemblage within the
topmost 100 m was estimated from recent research that used a
non-destructive in situ imaging system [18].
Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) was used to
explore dissimilarities between non-constitutive mixotrophic
species according to their spatial distributions. For this analysis,
we used the qualitative data (electronic supplementary material,
table S2) to build a presence\U2013absence matrix of species occurrences
across the different provinces and biomes (electronic
supplementary material, table S1). The quantitative distribution
of the NCMs across the seven biomes was also analysed, as
was the seasonal progression of biomass for mixotrophic ciliates
(both GNCMs and pSNCMs) and Rhizaria (eSNCMs). Two-way
ANOVAs were conducted to compare mixotrophic biomass (relative
and absolute values) across time and space. All analyses
were carried out using R software [19].
3. Results
Our analysis revealed that acquired phototrophy is ubiquitous
in the global oceans; however, the biogeography of the three
functional groups differed markedly (figure 1). While the
eSNCMs were observed to be widely distributed, GNCMs
and pSNCMs were more restricted spatially (figure 1a,b
versus figure 1c). Indeed, each of the three major plankton
taxa within the eSNCM functional grouping (dinoflagellates,
Radiolaria and Foraminifera) has a wider distribution than
the GNCMs and the pSNCMs (electronic supplementary
material, figure S2).
The NMDS analysis based on the dissimilarities among
species distributions (derived from their presence or absence
within the biogeographic provinces) revealed species clustered
together according to the NCM functional groups (figure 2a).
Notably, pSNCMs were positioned between the GNCMs and
eSNCMs; certain pSNCM species (e.g. Amylax triacantha
and Dinophysis mitra) were closer to the GNCMs, while
others (e.g. Mesodinium rubrum and Dinophysis acuminata)
were closer to the eSNCMs. Spatially, while GNCMs were
mainly associated with the Temperate Seas, Polar Seas and
Mediterranean Sea biomes, eSNCMswere primarily associated
with the Oligotrophic Gyres, Coastal Upwelling and Equatorial
Upwelling biomes (figure 2a). The eSNCM distribution
was observed to follow two distinctly diverse patterns; one
group was closely related to the Equatorial Upwelling biome,
while a second cosmopolitan group occurred in the intersection
between most biomes (figure 2a). The Coastal Sea biome
was not associated with any single functional group; all the
NCM functional groups occurred at least in one biogeographic
province within this biome. Our results suggest that the
contribution of mixotrophic ciliates increases towards more
productive and less variable systems, while the opposite pattern
is expected for mixotrophic Rhizaria (figure 2b,c; see also
the electronic supplementary material).
The quantitative data analysis revealed that the biomass

according to the functional groups in a similar fashion as did
their presence/absence (figure 3; electronic supplementary
material, S4\U2013S6 and tables S5\U2013S6). The absolute biomass of
GNCMs was highest during summer within the Mediterranean
Sea biome (figure 3a), making up 70% of total ciliate
biomass (electronic supplementary material, figure S6). The
absolute pSNCM biomass (represented by Mesodinium)was
highest during spring in the Coastal Seas biome (figure 3b),
encompassing up to 80% of total ciliate biomass (electronic

4. Discussion
From our analysis, we conclude that mixotrophic plankton
with acquired phototrophy are prevalent across all ocean
biomes, from polar to tropical regions, and from coastal to
oceanic environments, in both hemispheres (figure 1). However,
the distribution patterns of the three functional types
(i.e. GNCMs, pSNCMs and eSNCMs) differed markedly
among provinces and also displayed seasonal variation. There
was no obvious latitudinal constraint on the occurrence
of GNCMs and pSNCMs (figure 1a,b). However, most records
for these functional groups were from studies of coastal
environments; there are very few reports of these groups
within oceanic systems, particularly from within oligotrophic
gyres [5,20,21]. By contrast, eSNCMswere present across all latitudinal
and coastal-oceanic gradients [5,18,22], with Radiolaria
and Foraminifera dominating oceanic waters at low latitudes
(08\U2013308 N and S; figure 1c). Quantitatively, the relative contribution
of GNCMs to total ciliate assemblage (abundance and
biomass) was lower in low latitudes (electronic supplementary
material, figure S7), while the contribution of mixotrophic
Rhizaria to total Rhizaria assemblage has been observed to
decrease towards the higher latitudes [18].
Protists with acquired phototrophy occur in an ecophysiological
continuum from species that have low or moderate
control over the acquired phototrophic machinery (GNCMs
and pSNCMs, respectively) to those that can strongly regulate
phototrophy by control of their endosymbiont populations
(eSNCMs) [5,6,11]. Our results suggest that these differences
are reflected in their biogeography (figure 2a). For example,
pSNCM species with lower physiological control over their
acquired plastids (e.g. A. triacantha and D. mitra) were closer
in the NMDS analysis to the GNCMs, while those with a
higher level of control (e.g. M. rubrum and D. acuminata) were
closer to the eSNCMs from coastal regions (figure 2a) [23,24].
While GNCMs and pSNCMs share biogeographies that are
similar and somewhat restricted to neritic regions, temporal
and spatial differences can be drawn between them. Within
temperate seas, GNCMs tend to dominate after the
phytoplankton bloom, particularly in summer, under stratified
water column conditions, while pSNCMs are more commonly
encountered during spring, in nutrient-replete conditions
(figure 3a,b). Mesodinium also thrive in upwelling zones, largely
due to their high rates of phototrophic growth in nutrient-rich
waters [12,23]. By contrast, GNCMs are usually outnumbered
by heterotrophic ciliates (mainly tintinnids) in upwelling
regions [25]. The striking dominance of eSNCMs among
n =36
biomes (figure 3c); the mixotrophic Rhizaria contributed
up to 65% of total Rhizaria biomass within these regions
(electronic supplementary material, figure S6).
While there is a paucity of data for GNCMs and Mesodinium
within certain oceanic regions and/or periods of the
year (electronic supplementary material, table S5), we carried
out the ANOVAs to gain a basic understanding of the impact
of seasonality and/or biomes on their biogeographies. These
ANOVAs (electronic supplementary material, table S7)
suggest that the combined effect of biome and season on
Mesodinium (absolute biomass) and mixotrophic Rhizaria
(absolute and relative biomass) was significant. The
ANOVA of relative biomass of GNCMs showed a significant
effect only when considering seasonality.

mixotrophs in less productive ecosystems with low abiotic
variability (figure 2b versus figure 2c), such as within the oligotrophic
open ocean, underscores the importance of resource
partitioning and symbiosis in these lownutrient environments,
and further helps to explain the anomalous preponderance of
large cells there [26]. The limited success of GNCMs in these
conditions could be attributed to the low availability of prey,
which is detrimental to growth of the GNCMs as they rely on
a near-constant supply of prey for acquired phototrophy as
well as for essential nutrients [5,11] (figure 2b,c).
Acquired phototrophy among microzooplankton has been
typically neglected in field and modelling studies; NCMs have
hitherto not been considered a major component of the microzooplankton.
According to our analysis, when we calculated
the average contribution of mixotrophs across temporal
and spatial scales, the mixotrophic ciliates (GNCMs \U00FE the
pSNCM Mesodinium) contribute approximately 45% to the
total ciliate numeric abundance, and approximately 40% of
total ciliate biomass (electronic supplementary material,
figure S4). A previous study estimated that approximately
30% of the numeric abundance of marine oligotrich ciliates
globally were mixotrophic (i.e. GNCMs) [27]. Among the
eSNCMs, nearly half of total Rhizaria biomass is composed
of mixotrophic taxa across all temporal and spatial scales (electronic
supplementary material, figure S5). Importantly, our
analysis reveals great variation not only in the presence of mixotrophs
temporally and spatially, but also on which mixotroph
functional group dominates which biome during specific
seasons. While, for simplicity, one may wish to refer to a
single numeric value defining mixotroph abundance, our
study indicates the danger of doing so, especially when conducting
modelling studies in support of ecosystem
management (e.g. HABs, fisheries and biogeochemistry).
The proposed new mixotroph-centric paradigm for marine
ecology [6,28] envisions a high proportion ofmarine planktonic
protists expressing mixotrophy, with a consequential more fully
embedded, intertwined set of interactions within the microbial
loop [29] than previously appreciated. There is an important
contrast in physiology, and thence ecology, among protists
with acquired phototrophy (NCMs; i.e. \U2018animals that photosynthesize\U2019),
and also between these and the better-studied
constitutive mixotrophs (i.e. \U2018plants that eat\U2019; the CMs). In the
upper water column, activity by GNCMs can shorten and
thus potentially increase the efficiency of energy transfer along
pelagic food webs [5,6,11]. In the open ocean, eSNCMs include

giant photosynthetic protists that contribute significantly tovertical
carbon flux, influencing the biological carbon pump
[18,28,30,31]. In eutrophic coastal regions, some pSNCMs and
eSNCMs form extensive blooms. Blooms of the pSNCM ciliate
Mesodinium spp. are of particularly concern, because they can
act as biogeochemical hotspots and are the source of the phototrophic
capability of the toxicogenic pSNCM, Dinophysis spp.
[32,33]. Dinophysis, an organism colloquially considered as
an alga rather than a microzooplankter with acquired phototrophy,
causes diarrhetic shellfish poisoning, which can be
responsible for closures of shellfish aquaculture operations
[14,16]. In the Arabian Sea, shifts from diatom blooms to those
of the eSNCM \U2018green Noctiluca\U2019 are circumstantially associated
with hypoxia, and may adversely affect fisheries in a coastal
ecosystem supporting 120 million people [15].
In conclusion, diverse physiological and ecological properties
are associatedwith various modes of acquiredphototrophy.
Our biogeographic analysis of plankton communities across the
world\U2019s oceans highlights the prevalence of planktonic protists
with acquired phototrophy through symbiotic associations
with prey or enslavement of their organelles. Thus, it is critically
important that appropriate NCM functional subgroups are
represented within conceptual and mathematical models supporting
marine research across all spatial and temporal scales
of observation. To support such action, it is necessary for surveys
and monitoring studies to routinely document the
presence of these organisms, to expect to find them rather
than consider them apriori as novelties.
